<h1 id="koseven-php-framework">Koseven PHP Framework</h1>

<p>Koseven is a PHP framework based on <a href="http://kohanaframework.org/">Kohana</a> 3.3.X . Fully compatible with Kohana and updated to work with PHP7</p>

<p>Koseven is an elegant, open source, and object oriented HMVC framework built using PHP7, by a team of volunteers. It aims to be swift, secure, and small.</p>

<p>Released under a <a href="LICENSE.md">BSD license</a>, Koseven can be used legally for any open source, commercial, or personal project.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-kohana-alternative">Why a Kohana alternative?</h2>

<p>I use Kohana 3.3.x in many live projects and migration will be really complex into any new PHP framework. Keeping the project alive and updated is a priority. Kohana team (which I belong too) will not release any new version. [Kohana is DEAD] (http://discourse.kohanaframework.org/t/search-for-collaborators/56)</p>

<p>I will keep updated tihs repo with any other new issues or features on Kohana.</p>

<h2 id="will-work-as-dropin-of-kohana">Will work as dropin of Kohana?</h2>

<p>If you were using 3.3.x version normally yes. Normally? theres 2 breaking changes that may affect you be aware. We have removed MySQL (you need to use MySQLi) and exception.php is now compatible with PHP7.</p>

<p>We have also added the pagination module.</p>

<h2 id="what-changes-have-you-made">What changes have you made?</h2>

<p>So far is exactly as last stable version of KO 3.3.6 released on Jul 25, 2016. But compatible with PHP 7 / PHP 7.1. I personally would like only to add fixes, bug fixes, speed improvements and the rest leave it for the modules.</p>

<h2 id="are-modules-of-kohana-compatible">Are modules of Kohana compatible?</h2>

<p>Yes they are, just be sure are compatible with KO 3.3.X.</p>

<h2 id="why-all-modules-in-1-repo">Why all modules in 1 repo?</h2>

<p>This is a personal choice for me to keep the project as simple and easier to manage, modules are not enabled by default, just do not enable those you will not use.</p>
